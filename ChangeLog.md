CHANGELOG

While I already included a lot... I'll just begin on May 7th

May 7th, 2015
  - Essentially built the whole thing
  - Added a removeDuplicates method
  - Added "Get" methods for string and array
  - Added toFile method to print out results to a .txt
  - Expanded my JUnit tests (100% working)

May 8th. 2015
  - Added GUI with selectable file choosing
  - Exported it as a .jar (worked, YAY!)
  - Thinking of creating a .exe, or jnlp
