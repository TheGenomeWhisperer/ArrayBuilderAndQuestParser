CHANGELOG

**January 8th, 2015**
  - Cleaned up the output.  I had been wanting to do this for a while
  - Adjusted the way the QuestPars.quests *string* reads out, so every 17 quest IDs it projects a new line by using "\n"

**May 7th, 2015**
  - Essentially built the whole thing
  - Added a removeDuplicates method
  - Added "Get" methods for string and array
  - Added toFile method to print out results to a .txt
  - Expanded my JUnit tests (100% working)

**May 8th. 2015**
  - Added GUI with selectable file choosing
  - Exported it as a .jar (worked, YAY!)
  - Thinking of creating a .exe, or jnlp
