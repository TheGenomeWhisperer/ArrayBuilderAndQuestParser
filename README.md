# ArrayBuilderAndQuestParser
___________________________

***What This Is:***

This will take any .txt or .json, or really, any file's raw data into a string, then any 5 number sequence it will output it.

***What is the Purpose?***

Whilst building my rather large scripting profiles for Warcraft, I realized the value in doing a progression check before parsing the whole script for progress left undone.  So, to be able to do this,I would have to go into the script, which is quite long, and manually extract each quest ID.  Wow, we are talking about at least 9-10hrs of the most mundane and tedious work, and it also did not prevent me from having to do it again with any future profiles I would build.  So, after realizing I can export the entire script as a *.json* file, I could then parse through it and compile all of the quests I refenced and called to.

Thus, now, with zero effort now that the script is built, all I have to do is import my raw data, which often is 30,000 + lines of code, and it will instantly parse through it and extract all of the quests.  It's future-proof as well.

*Example:*
The Program is simple!

The output will be in whichever folder the program is placed:
