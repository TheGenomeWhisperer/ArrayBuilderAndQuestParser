# ArrayBuilderAndQuestParser
___________________________

In Conjunction with the "Rebot" Warcraft program (Rebot.to)
the questing profiles can be quite tedious to keep track of all
of the added quest IDs, so I basically created a way to take 
a quest profile exported as a .txt of any size, parse through it
and collect all the IDs. For quality of life, it exports
the data into an easily copyable format to paste straight into
the official Rebot editor in C# format for quest progress checking
