# ArrayBuilderAndQuestParser
___________________________

This will take any imported txt file, parse through it,
and build both an array && a string of all 5 number equivalents.
This is mainly used to parse the massive questing profiles and return all quests.
It filters repeat quests as to return only 1 instance of it if it finds many.
